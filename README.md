# SMART-FALL-DETECTION-SYSTEM-FOR-ELDERLY-SAFETY-USING-MPU6050-AND-WI-FI-BASED-ALERT-MECHANISM
Smart Fall Detection System for Elderly Safety Using MPU6050 with Wi-Fi-Based Alert Mechanism is an IoT-based wearable device designed to enhance elderly care by detecting accidental falls and immediately alerting caregivers via Telegram notifications. The system utilizes the MPU6050 sensor for real-time motion tracking and a multi-stage fall detection algorithm to ensure high accuracy (~90%) with minimal false positives. Powered by the Wi-Fi-enabled NodeMCU ESP8266, it enables instant cloud communication and also activates a solenoid lock to grant emergency room access when needed. Developed using the Arduino IDE, this project integrates the Telegram Bot API to provide seamless alerts, all while maintaining affordability and a strong focus on real-world impact. It represents a meaningful step toward using technology for social good, particularly in improving the safety and independence of the aging population.
